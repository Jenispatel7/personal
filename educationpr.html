    <ul>
      <li> Object-oriented programming (oop).
        <ul>
          <li> modularization, abstraction, encapsulation/information hiding, software reuse, software testing, classic data abstractions (e.g., lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching), recursion, program correctness, and basic
            algorithm analysis.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Data structure and algorithm.
        <ul>
          <li> algorithm structure, and encapsulation as they pertain to the development of object-oriented software. Abstract data types studied include stacks, queues, binary trees, n-ary trees, and graphs. Various representation alternatives are
            analyzed and compared, trade-offs frequently encountered</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li> Machine Organ & Assembly Prog.
        <ul>
          <li> organization and architecture of computers through an exploration of various virtual machines. Programming at the assembly-language level and interfacing with software components (primarily written in C). Topics include representation of
            data and instructions, computer arithmetic, memory hierarchies, instruction sets, addressing modes, digital logic, microprogramming, pipelining, and parallel processing.</li>

      <li> Theoretical Foundation of CMPS.
        <ul>
          <li>fundamental models and concepts of computation – automata, formal languages, and grammars – and how they are related. Church-Turing thesis; recursive and recursively enumerable sets; unsolvable problems; complexity of algorithms; Chomskyhierarchy.</li>
